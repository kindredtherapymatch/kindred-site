   and it could no longer apply to anybody: nobody pays at signup, and its last
   tier closed 1 Dec 2026 while the first renewal is six months after go-live. What it still
   did was keep `founding` branches alive across three screens, each ready to
   quote a rate no checkout would honour.

   Matches the $29.99/month price already behind the Stripe payment links, so

/* ===== NAMES ==================================================================
   A therapist's name is the single most personal thing on the card, and
   "Kennady SCott" shipped to the public profile because nothing ever looked at
   it. But a name checker is one of the easiest things in software to get
   wrong, and getting it wrong on a therapy product means telling someone their
   own name is a mistake.

   SO: SUGGEST, NEVER SILENTLY CORRECT. Every one of these is a real name --
     McDonald  MacLeod  DeShawn  JoAnn  O'Brien  d'Angelo  van der Berg
     IJsselstein (the Dutch IJ digraph is genuinely two capitals)
     bell hooks (deliberately lowercase)
   Title-casing that list would mangle most of it. Nothing here rewrites a name
   on its own; it offers, and "keep it as I typed it" is always one tap away.

   The one pattern worth flagging is a shift-key slip: two or more capitals at
   the START of a word followed by lowercase -- SCott, KEnnady, THomas. That is
   distinct from McDonald (cap, lower, cap) and from initials like "JW Smith"
   (all caps, no lowercase tail). It still catches IJsselstein, which is why
   the escape hatch exists rather than being an edge case nobody thought about.

   Whitespace IS normalised silently -- collapsing a double space and trimming
   the ends cannot mangle anybody's name, and a trailing space is never
   deliberate. */
function tidyNameWhitespace(s) {
  return String(s == null ? '' : s).replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim();
}

/* "Keep what I typed", remembered against the exact spelling. Deliberately NOT
   a column: this is a UI acknowledgement, and profileGaps() has to keep
   mirroring the SQL publish gate exactly -- adding a browser-only condition to
   it would let localStorage and the database disagree about whether someone is
   live, which is the bug this whole stretch of work has been about. Worst case
   on a new device is being asked once more and tapping keep. */

/* ===== WHAT A PROFILE NEEDS BEFORE A CLIENT SHOULD SEE IT ====================
   The bar was `name is not null` -- client-side and in the database. So a
   therapist could pay, verify, go live, and be shown to clients as a name, a
   "Specialties" heading with nothing under it, and a "Get to Know Them"
   section that was empty. Every checklist on the page said they were set up.

   Kindred's pitch is "more than a specialty": clients are matched on how
   someone works, and the profile is the only place that exists. A blank one
   is worse than no listing -- it is a client's first impression of the whole
   product, and it says there is nothing here.

   Two essentials beyond the name, chosen because each is load-bearing for a
   different half of the pitch:
     SPECIALTIES  what matching filters on, and the tags on the card
     ONE ANSWER   the voice -- the thing a directory doesn't have
   Deliberately NOT a length or quality bar. "At least one" is a floor against
   emptiness, not an editor. */
/* MUST accept exactly the same set as profile_is_publishable() in migration
   0027. If the database is stricter, the app calls a profile finished and the
   therapist silently never appears; if the app is stricter, it withholds
   someone the database is already showing. Either way it is the same class of
   contradiction as the billing copy. The columns a therapist's words can land
   in are: best_for, prompt_fit, persona.inOffice/outOfOffice, any
   optional_prompts answer, any blocks prompt answer. */

/* What is still missing, named the way a therapist would name it. Returned as

/* ===== "Does this look finished?" =====================================
   A live profile showed clients "getting your shit together" twice and a
   bare "test" in three prompts. These fields are the first thing a
   prospective client reads, so filler here does not read as a rough draft --
   it reads as someone who did not care enough to finish.

   Two DIFFERENT kinds of problem, deliberately handled differently:

   * PLACEHOLDER text is never intentional. "test", "asdf", "tbd" -- nobody
     means those. Blocks publishing, same as a missing photo.
   * PROFANITY may be exactly the voice a therapist wants. Plenty of good
     ones swear on purpose, and a product that silently sanitises how a
     therapist talks is worse than one that shows a warning. Warns, never
     blocks. Their profile, their voice; we just make sure they meant it.

   Placeholder matching is WHOLE-VALUE, not substring, and that is the whole
   trick: "I work with test anxiety" contains "test" and must never be
   flagged, while a field whose entire content is "test" always is. */

/* ===== WHAT IS THIS LISTING ACTUALLY DOING =====================================
   The Home banner and Settings each worked this out for themselves and reached
   opposite answers on the same screen: the banner required license AND identity
   before saying "live", Settings said "Your profile is live" the moment billing
   started. A therapist could read "You're being billed but clients can't see
   you yet" and "Listed — $29.99/mo. Your profile is live." three inches apart.

   Two facts, deliberately separate, because they move independently:
     MONEY       none | trial | charging      (from Stripe's subscription_status)
     VISIBILITY  listed && license && identity

   `listed` means the subscription exists -- the webhook flips `published` for
   BOTH 'active' and 'trialing' -- so it has never meant "a client can see you",
   and reading it as though it did is the whole bug.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Looking costs nothing and identifies nobody, so Discover is open to anyone.
   The moment an action would keep something -- a saved therapist, a request, a
   booking -- there has to be somewhere to keep it, and someone to keep it for.

   ONE function decides. Six call sites (heart, contact, Short List, Top 5,
   On-Demand, You) asking the same question in six slightly different ways is
   how one of them ends up asking it wrong, and the one that gets it wrong is
   the one that stores a stranger's data.

   WHAT AN ACCOUNT IS, AND IS NOT. Creating one is an email and a password --
   a Supabase auth user, nothing else. It is deliberately NOT the same switch
   as clientDataPersistence, which still governs whether their intake answers,
   matches and messages are written to our tables. So today someone can have
   an account and be reachable, while the clinical content of what they said
   stays on their own device until the BAA is signed.

   That split is the point: the email is what makes a person contactable, and
   it is a far smaller disclosure than the answers to eleven questions about
   why they are seeking therapy. */

/* ---- partial signup saves -------------------------------------------------
   The therapist row was only written when the wizard FINISHED. Someone who
   made an account, typed their name, added a license and then closed the tab
   left nothing behind but an auth user -- their work was gone, and there was
   no way to tell "started and stalled" from "never began".

   Now every Continue writes what exists so far. Two rules keep that safe:
     - only non-empty values are sent, because PostgREST's merge-duplicates
       upsert overwrites every column in the payload, so posting an empty
       array would erase a real one on the next step;
     - it never sends `published`, same as the full save -- billing owns that.

   Best-effort and silent: a failed autosave must not interrupt someone in the
   middle of writing their profile. localStorage is not a fallback here because
   the point is reaching a database you can email from.

       still holding it, and nothing moved. Reordering is the whole point of
       the feature, so it was broken rather than awkward.

       Driven by a timer off the last known pointer Y rather than by dragover,
       because dragover stops firing the moment the cursor stops moving --
       which is exactly what happens when you hold a block against the top
       edge and wait for the page to come to you.

       setInterval rather than requestAnimationFrame: rAF is tied to painting,

      <li><strong>Cash-pay only.</strong> No insurance is billed for On-Demand sessions.</li>
      <li><strong>Clients pay up front.</strong> The client's card is authorized when they request a slot and charged the moment you accept — you never chase payment.</li>
      <li><strong>You meet outside the app.</strong> Kindred handles the request and payment; you schedule and hold the actual session on your own platform.</li>
      <li><strong>One processing fee.</strong> Card processing and platform costs come out of each On-Demand session &mdash; you see the exact figure, and your take-home, before you agree.</li>
